                    <p>
                    <p>Being a Pet Stylist for the past 17 years as well as one of the pioneers and successful freelance house to house groomer. I have great passion in training dogs and was formerly a police dog handler in the K9 unit (formerly known as the "PDU").</p>

                    <p>I am pursuing my interest in dogs’ behavioural training and I am very excited to share with you my experience in correcting undesirable behaviours.</p>

                    <p>With my passion, I have started my own Dogs Behavioural Corrective Programme (“BCP”). BCP is inspired by the renowned professional. I am pleased to announce that the company is now registered and named "The K9 Pack Leader". </p>

<p>I fully understand that having an imbalanced dog can be stressful, causing unhappiness at home, tension with neighbours or even other dogs’ owners. This is the reason why, I have decided to introduce my own BCP.</p>

<p>With this training, it enables you to be IN-CHARGE of your own home, to become the Pack Leader, to have a balance dog and Not having a Dog in-charge of you. The objective of BCP is to remove their Undesirable Behaviour, namely excessive barking, food aggression and charging at other furry friends or even your guests and restore your dog back to their original state. With BCP, your furry friend will learn to stay calm and submissive. As such, not only will it strengthen the family bond, it keeps the Balance, Love, Joy and Peace at home.</p>

<p>Be a real calm assertive Pack Leader! </p>
